# jedha-projects

Collection of Jedha projects for certification.

This repository contains the various projects required for the validation of:
- The certification "Concepteur developpeur en science des donnees" (RNCP35288)
- The certification "Architecte en Intelligence Artificielle" (RNCP38777)

The projects are divided into 8 blocks. Blocks 1 - 5 are required for the CDSD certification, and blocks 6-8 are required for the AIA certificate.

In addition, the two certifications require a "final project" for validation. The same project was adapted to both certifications and is available [here](https://github.com/netesf13d/crypto-crash-detection).
