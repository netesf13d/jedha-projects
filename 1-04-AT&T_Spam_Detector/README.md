# AT&T Spam Detector

This project is an application of deep learning to the treatment of textual data. The goal is to predict the weekly sales of Walmart stores from external factors such as economical indicators or environmental factors. We follow the standart approach to tackle this kind of problem:
- make a preliminary EDA to better understand the data;
- build a simple and easily interpretable model (here a linear regression), and assess its performance;
- try to improve it.

The dataset is a collection of SMS hams and spams from various sources [[1]](#1). The version provided for the project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). However, this version has many issues related to text encoding and character escaping. This project rather uses the original version[[2]](#1), available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection), which has no such problems.


## Structure of the project

This project repository is structured as follows.

- The directory `scripts` contains the study as a python script.
- The directory `data` contains the relevant data for the project.
- The file `requirements.txt` gives the list of the project dependencies.
