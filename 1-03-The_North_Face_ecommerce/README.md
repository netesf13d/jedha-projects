# The North Face ecommerce

This project is an application of unsupervised machine learning. The goal is to clusterize an e-commerce product catalog and extract its semantic content. Our study is structured as follows:
- Identify groups of products that have similar descriptions.
- Design a simple recommendation algorithm to find similar items.
- Identify the main topics present in product descriptions.

The dataset is composed of 500 items descriptions, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cclark/product-item-data). The descriptions contain some spurious HTML elements, and were probably scraped from a website.
