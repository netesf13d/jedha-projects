# The North Face ecommerce

This project is an application of unsupervised machine learning.


The dataset originally comes from a Kaggle competition organized by Walmart. The original version can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data). The dataset used in this project is the same, without the stores information nor the features labeled `MarkDown*`.
