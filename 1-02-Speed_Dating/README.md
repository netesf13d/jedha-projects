# Speed Dating

In this project we conduct an exploratory data analysis of a speed dating experiment. We adopt the perspective of an analyst willing to understand which factors influence the general attractiveness of a potential mating partner. We divide our study in two parts:
- a general description of the participants;
- the results of the speed dating experiment.

On a weekly basis between 2002 and 2004, small groups of males and females students from Columbia university were involved weekly in heterosexual speed dating sessions. The data was collected in a survey before, during and after the actual dating session. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment).


## Structure of the project

This project repository is structured as follows.
- The Jupyter notebook `Speed_Dating.ipynb` presents the results of our study. This is the main deliverable for the certification.
- The directory `scripts` contains the exploratory data analysis as a python script.
- The file `requirements.txt` gives the list of the project dependencies. 
- The directory `presentation` contains the slideshow for the exam, in both `odp` and `pdf` formats.


## Usage

To setup the Python environment:
- With `pip`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Using `conda`, run `conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt`
