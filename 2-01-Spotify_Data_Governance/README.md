# Spotify Data Governance

In this project, we step into the role of a Data Governance Specialist for Spotify, the world's leading music streaming platform. The goal is to design and pilot a Data Governance Framework that ensures regulatory compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and PCI-DSS, while also improving data quality, user privacy, and operational efficiency across Spotify's global infrastructure.

The project is structured into four timed phases: assessing data maturity, developing governance policies and roles, building an implementation roadmap, and preparing an executive presentation. We integrate real-world compliance checklists, best-practice frameworks, and scalable governance models into our solution.
