\title{Spotify Data Governance Framework Implementation}
\date{}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\vspace{-10mm}

This document outlines how Spotify should operationalize its Data Governance Framework, including the organizational model, tools, pilot plan, and execution steps.

\section*{Organizational Model}

Given the size of the company and the amount of data to manage, the recommended approach is that of the center of excellence (CoE) model. In this model, a central data governance team, lead by the CDO, defines the standards and practices for data management. It also provides training and support to the data teams embedded in each department (e.g. marketing, product, engineering). A cross-functional governance committee of data engineers, legal councils, data protection officer and business leaders oversights data management and compliance.

In the context of this organizational model, both full-code and low/no-code solutions will be used.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Full-code} technologies are mandatory among the CoE team. They must also be available among the embedded teams to allow for interfacing data manipulation with the CoE team.
	\item \textbf{Low/No-code} technologies are key to the embedded teams in the different department. They provide high data availability for a large volume of non-tech people such as business analysts.
\end{itemize}

It is of course recommended to avoid redundancy by selecting a single tool for a given purpose.


\section*{Pilot implementation}

\subsection*{Overview of the Pilot Implementation}

\textbf{Objective of the Pilot:}\\
To validate the effectiveness of Spotifyâ€™s new Data Governance Framework by applying it to the User Engagement Data domain. The rationale behind this choice is that user data is central to key components of the governance plan: compliance, quality and security. This dataset includes user interactions such as play history, search behavior, and playlist creation. The pilot aims to enhance data quality, ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance, and improve internal accessibility and reliability of engagement insights.

\textbf{Scope of the Pilot:}\\
The pilot will focus on the User Engagement Data used by the Product, Marketing, and Analytics teams to assess content performance and drive personalization strategies.


\subsection*{Key Goals}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=5pt, parsep=0pt]
	\item \textbf{Improve Data Quality} (accuracy, completeness, consistency) in engagement records
	\item \textbf{Ensure Compliance} with GDPR/CCPA for user behavior data
	\item \textbf{Streamline Access} to clean, governed engagement data for authorized staff
	\item \textbf{Mitigate Risks} associated with personal data misuse or poor data quality
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Pilot Team and Roles}

\begin{table}[ht]

			Team member & Role & Responsibilities \\
			\midrule
			- & Pilot Project Manager & Oversees pilot execution, coordination, and reporting \\
			- & Data Steward & Manages quality and documentation of engagement data \\
			- & Data Protection Officer (DPO) & Conducts privacy audits and ensures GDPR/CCPA compliance \\
			- & Data Analyst Engineer & Implements quality monitoring and access control tools \\
			- & Product Department Lead & Aligns implementation with product strategy and insights \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabularx}
	\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


\subsection*{Timeline and Milestones}
