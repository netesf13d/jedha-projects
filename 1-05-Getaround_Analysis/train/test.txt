1. Verify the IAM user or role credentials:
   - Navigate to the IAM console
   - Locate the IAM user or role associated with the ARN 'arn:aws:iam::699475941446:root'
   - Ensure the access key and secret key are valid and active

2. Check the time synchronization:
   - Verify that the system clock on the device or server making the API request is correctly synchronized
   - Use a reliable time synchronization service to ensure accurate time

3. Review the S3 bucket policy:
   - Go to the S3 console
   - Select the bucket 'mlflow-artifact-store-1-05-getaround'
   - Click on the 'Permissions' tab
   - Review the bucket policy to ensure it allows the necessary actions for the IAM user or role

4. If you don't have permissions to do the following changes, contact your AWS Administrator:
   - Create a new IAM policy with the following permissions:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "s3:PutObject",
             "s3:GetBucketLocation"
           ],
           "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::mlflow-artifact-store-1-05-getaround",
             "arn:aws:s3:::mlflow-artifact-store-1-05-getaround/*"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Attach this policy to the IAM user or role associated with the ARN 'arn:aws:iam::699475941446:root'

5. Clear browser cache and cookies:
   - Open browser settings
   - Clear cache and cookies
   - Restart the browser and try accessing the S3 console again

6. Try accessing the S3 bucket from a different browser or incognito/private mode

7. If the issue persists, contact AWS Support:
   - Go to the AWS Support Center
   - Create a new case
   - Provide the error message and the steps you've taken to troubleshoot
