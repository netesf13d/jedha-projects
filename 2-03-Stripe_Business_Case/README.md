# Stripe Business Case

This project simulates a real-world business case at Stripe, a leading FinTech company, with a focus on designing a robust and scalable data architecture. The primary aim is to evaluate the candidate’s ability to integrate and optimize data systems spanning transactional (OLTP), analytical (OLAP), and NoSQL databases. The goal is to address Stripe's growing need for real-time processing, advanced analytics, and the handling of semi-structured data, while ensuring compliance with global data security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

We design design detailed data models for OLTP, OLAP, and NoSQL systems, develop a unified data pipeline architecture, and propose strategies for performance optimization, data consistency, and system security. The project also requires to integrate machine learning workflows for use cases such as fraud detection and customer personalization. Deliverables include entity relationship diagrams, schema designs, pipeline blueprints, compliance strategies, and example queries—demonstrating end-to-end data engineering proficiency in a complex, high-stakes environment.
